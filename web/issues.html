<h2>Problems with Current Voting Methods</h2>
<p>The current voting methods, both in-person and mail-in, present several problems that undermine the integrity and trustworthiness of elections. For example, in-person voting requires voters to place their ballots in a box with no way to verify if their vote was counted correctly. Mail-in voting, while convenient, is susceptible to fraud since anyone can fill out a ballot and send it in. Additionally, mail-in voting does not guarantee voter anonymity, as those handling the ballots can see who submitted each one.</p>
<p>Another significant issue arises in elections with more than two candidates, where a winner might be elected with only a plurality of the vote. This situation can be problematic as the winner does not represent the majority of voters. Ideally, a runoff election would be held to ensure the winner receives more than 50% of the vote, but traditional runoff elections are often impractical and costly. Votetorrent addresses these challenges by enabling electronic runoff elections, making them feasible and efficient.</p>
