/**
 * strand-read.js -- the officer dashboard's strand reader: every replicated officer table, read
 * through the member node's OWN strand database, returned as row ops for the local copy.
 *
 * It is the officer twin of the Public page's `src/peer/strand-read.js`, copied in structure and not
 * imported (the apps never import each other). It differs from that file in three ways:
 *
 * 1. ONE DATABASE PER STRAND, AND IT IS CADRE-CORE'S. The Public page has no cadre membership, so it
 *    builds its own `StrandDatabase` over its edge node. The dashboard's member node has already
 *    claimed the strand through cadre-core, and cadre-core keeps exactly one `StrandDatabase` for it
 *    (`StrandInstance.database`). This file reads through that one, as handed out by
 *    `memberNode.getStrandDatabase(strandId)`. That is the path the pair-mint harness leg PM-7 proved
 *    on a storage-withdrawn edge node. cadre-core owns that database's lifecycle (it builds it when
 *    the strand header arrives, rebuilds it, and closes it when the node stops), so this file never
 *    closes it and never builds a second one.
 *
 * 2. THE OFFICER ALLOWLIST. Tables come only from `OFFICER_SUBSCRIBED_TABLES`, which web-data derives
 *    from the officer read modules, the advisory gate's tables and the pairing tables. It is imported,
 *    never restated here.
 *
 * 3. DELETE-AWARE. The Public reader skips a table whose strand read returned zero rows. That cannot
 *    work for a copy that must converge: when the last row of a table is removed on the strand, the
 *    read is empty, and a skipped table would keep the removed row locally for ever. So `readRows`
 *    takes the local primary keys and returns a removal op for every local key the strand no longer
 *    holds. A table is skipped (returns no ops) only when it is empty on BOTH sides.
 *
 * READING IS THIS FILE'S WHOLE JOB. It never writes and never opens a local store handle. The
 * reactivity bridge owns applying the ops.
 *
 * THE NETWORK TRANSACTOR. A strand database whose resolved transactor is not 'network' would read
 * this node's own raw storage with no peer consulted, a page that looks right while replicating
 * nothing. The reader asserts 'network' on every strand database object it prepares, including one
 * cadre-core rebuilt after the reader opened.
 *
 * THE VOTE-ENGINE SQL FUNCTIONS. cadre-core registers its own crypto plugin on the strand database,
 * which does not provide vote-engine's custom functions (`SignatureValidP256` and the others). The
 * pairing checks read through this reader and need them, so the reader runs vote-engine's
 * `registerDbPlugins` once per Database object it prepares.
 *
 * A PROGRESS-AWARE WAIT (gap G-3). cadre-core publishes the strand database only when a joining
 * machine's first build is done, and over the relay to slow phones that build was measured running for
 * minutes while it fetched block after block. A fixed deadline refused it while it was still working. So
 * the wait for the database ends on a STALL, `STRAND_DB_STALL_MS` with no progress, or at a HARD CAP,
 * `STRAND_DB_CAP_MS` in all, whichever comes first. Progress is what the strand node receives, as
 * `strand-progress.js` counts it (answered data streams, blocks landing in its store). A strand node that
 * receives nothing fails at the stall window, sooner than the old fixed wait did. Both endings throw the
 * same `StrandReadError` (subject `strandDatabase`, code `'timeout'`); the reason text says which.
 *
 * NO IMPORT-TIME WORK. The pairing code reaches this module through a lazy `import()`. Module scope
 * holds only imports, constants, the error class and function declarations.
 *
 * SQL IDENTIFIER NOTE. The one query this file builds interpolates a TABLE NAME, and that name is
 * always a member of the frozen allowlist (checked before the query is built). Column names come only
 * from the local schema, and there are no bound values to interpolate.
 *
 * ACCEPTED RESIDUAL (threat T-66-13-07). A strand read that returns zero rows for a table that holds
 * local rows removes those rows locally. That is required for a real last-row removal to be seen. If
 * the empty read was wrong, the next pass (at most 20 s later) restores anything still on the strand,
 * and the panels' change marks show the removal and the return.
 *
 * ERROR HYGIENE. Errors carry a subject (a table or option name) and never a row value, a key value
 * or Quereus message text. An underlying error is reduced to its name.
